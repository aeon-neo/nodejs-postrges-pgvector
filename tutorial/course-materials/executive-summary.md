# Course Executive Summary: Environment Setup for PostgreSQL Vector Databases

## Course Overview

This comprehensive course teaches environment setup and verification for PostgreSQL vector database applications through hands-on exploration of a real-world TypeScript verification utility. Students learn by examining, understanding, and working with the actual project code at `src/utils/verify-setup.ts`.

## Learning Philosophy: Real Code Walkthrough

Unlike traditional courses that use simplified examples, this course follows a "real code walkthrough" approach:

- **File-Based Learning**: Students examine actual implementations at specific line numbers
- **Production Patterns**: Learn from working, tested code that follows professional standards
- **Practical Application**: Every concept is demonstrated through functional code
