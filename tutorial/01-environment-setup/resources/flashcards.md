# Section 1: Development Environment Setup - Flashcards

### **What is the total number of lectures in this course?**

6 focused lectures organized in a 3+3 structure across two main sections covering environment setup and implementation.

### **How are the lectures organized into sections?**

Section 1 (Lectures 1-3): Development Environment Setup; Section 2 (Lectures 4-6): PostgreSQL Vector Database Implementation.

### **What learning philosophy does this course follow?**

"Real code walkthrough" - no simplified examples, all learning through actual project files and production-quality implementations.

### **Who is the instructor and what is their background?**

Joel Smalley, MBA with 25+ years in digital transformation, database technologies, AI/ML, and production PostgreSQL + pgvector experience.

### **What makes this course unique compared to traditional programming courses?**

File-based learning using actual 151-line production code, no code snippets, professional patterns, and real-world verification utility.

### **What command sets Claude Code to explanatory output style?**

/output-style explanatory - enables detailed explanations, educational insights, and reasoning behind database design decisions.

### **Why is Claude Code setup the first technical step in the course?**

Configure AI learning companion before technical setup to provide educational assistance, debugging help, and code analysis throughout the course.

### **What types of prompts work best with Claude Code for this project?**

Reference specific files and line numbers (e.g., "analyze src/utils/verify-setup.ts lines 44-50") for context-aware educational responses.

### **How should you reference code when asking Claude Code questions?**

Include file paths and line numbers, paste specific error messages, mention environment details, and provide current implementation context.

### **What role does Claude Code play throughout the learning journey?**

Educational partner providing explanations, debugging assistance, code analysis, and learning-focused responses with professional insights.

### **What file contains the TypeScript compiler configuration?**

tsconfig.json - contains compiler options including target (ES2022), output directory (./dist), and strict type checking settings.

### **What TypeScript target is specified in tsconfig.json and why?**

ES2022 for modern JavaScript features and Node.js 18+ compatibility with optimal async/await support for database operations.

### **Which directory contains compiled JavaScript output?**

./dist - configured in tsconfig.json outDir option, maintains source directory structure for production deployment.

### **What does the "strict" compiler option enable in TypeScript?**

Enhanced type checking including noImplicitAny and strictNullChecks for better error detection in database operations.

### **How does ts-node differ from compiled JavaScript execution?**

ts-node executes TypeScript directly (slower, development), compiled JavaScript runs faster (production) from dist/ directory.

### **What command installs project dependencies?**

npm install - installs TypeScript, PostgreSQL client, dotenv, and development dependencies for database application development.

### **Which script in package.json runs the verification utility?**

verify-setup - executes ts-node src/utils/verify-setup.ts to test the complete development environment setup.

### **What is the purpose of the .env.example file?**

Template for environment variables - copy to .env and configure PostgreSQL connection settings for database connectivity.

### **How does the current project structure support database development?**

TypeScript configuration optimized for Node.js, strict type checking for database operations, and verification utility for environment validation.

### **What development workflow limitation exists in the current setup?**

The dev script references non-existent src/index.ts - project currently focuses on verification utility rather than full application.
